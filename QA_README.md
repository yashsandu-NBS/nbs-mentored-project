### Why are we doing this?
This challenge is 

### Possible improvements for future challenges.


### How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the base challenge to be very straightforward because it was explained very well in the video call. 
Any doubts was all cleared. I expected the stretch goal to be challenging as configuring roles can be tricky as there are lots of components to be handled.

### What went well?
The base challenge went really well. I got the base structure working very well. However, I did struggle with the service: start for Docker.
My initial approach was not right but after reading community again i made the relevant changes and it worked. 

The stretch goal went smoother than initially thought. Followed QA community on how to deploy NGINX contianer. 
However, it did require modifications to make it work.

### What didn't go as planned?


### Possible improvements for future challenges.
Attempt the stretch goals. 

Thank you Ben!

## NBS Mentored Project
This repository contains the solutions to the NBS Mentored Project.

### Why are we doing this?
This challenge is to test our knowledge on all the tools and software we have learnt in the QA Training. Through this challenge, we can can see how all the
tools work together in an amalgamation and how we are expected to use these tools in the professional world.

### How I expected the challenge to go.
I expected the base task to be challenging because it is the first time we are trying to put all the tools together and see how they communicate with each other.
So I expected to be a lot of errors and difficulties where tools would not work together or the strategy taken may not be the best.

### What went well?
The base challenge went really well. I got the base structure working very well and within the deadline. I really enjoyed my time working on it. 
It did test my knowledge what we had learnt so far.

However, I did struggle with the Nexus and SAST Testing. With Nexus, my approach and method was right but unfortunately the system was using the old image which
resulted in lot of compilation errors. This was fixed with the help of Ben. 
SAST Testing took a long time to do mainly because of VMs causing unexpected crashes and resets throughout that week resulting in longer time to attempt the work.
It did take some time to understand the best way to boot up the SonarQube and I chose the Docker-Compose route as my Jenkins was running from Linux locally. 
My error of using http://sonarqube:9000 rather than http://localhost:9000 in the configuration settings hence the link between Jenkins and SonarQube 
was not being established, this was fixed by watching the recorded videos which were very helpful.

### What didn't go as planned?
I was aiming to finish stretch goals too. Unfortunately this was not completed in the given timeframe. 

### Possible improvements for future challenges.
Attempt the stretch goals. 

Thank you Ben!
